## Student Echo: A Revolutionary Rating Service for the University of Manitoba

**CLEAR SUMMARY SENTENCE**
Student Echo is a dedicated platform to enable verified students to provide insightful ratings and reviews for courses and instructors at the University of Manitoba. By doing so, it establishes a robust repository of accurate and valuable data, empowering individuals to make informed decisions based on authentic student experiences.

**TARGET AUDIENCE (with roles and actions)**
The platform is primarily designed for student use. Students can select a course or instructor and share thier feedback in the form of a rating and review. Should a course or instructor not yet exist in the system, students will be able to contribute such information. Students may also modify and delete their own ratings or reviews.

The platform extends itself to a broader audience as well. Such individuals include instructors, administrative personnel, future students, and more. Ratings and reviews for a course or instructor are public information, accessible for viewing to any individual using the platform. Users can sort and filter this data based on desired critera, such as overall rating.

**VALUE OF PROJECT**
Student Echo provides tremendous value to numerous individuals in the university community. For freshmen, it's a guiding light to navigate through new academic waters, while seniors will find it a strategic tool for optimizing their final year. Instructors can use it as a tool to assess student satisfaction in thier courses. Administrative staff can review instructor and course feedback to make informed and practical decisions.

Student Echo is superior to current similar services for numerous reasons. Requiring student identity verification to post information enhances data integrity. Unlike many other services that permit anyone to post reviews, this measure ensures a more reliable and trustworthy data environment. Student Echo is a free service that ensures full transparacy by enabling all individuals to access its data. Student Echo is specifically designed for the University of Manitoba, ensuring a managable information load to its users.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA (measurable & objective)**
Both user feedback and user adoption will be used as success critera. User feedback will be obtained in the form of a survey, with the goal of achieveing 4/5 or better for overall satisfaction. User adoption will be monitored based on user accounts created, with a goal of 500 accounts created within the first three months of launching Student Echo.
