**Student Echo: A Revolutionary Rating Service for the University of Manitoba**

**Summary**

Student Echo is a dedicated service that enables verified students to provide and access insightful evaluations of courses and instructors at the University of Manitoba.

**What is Student Echo?**

Student Echo is a place where registered students can share their opinions on a course or instructor in the form of a rating and review. These entries can be edited, and even deleted, by the original writer. They also have the power to transform and develop the community in Student Echo by interacting with other reviews (through likes, dislikes, and reporting) and adding any course or instructor that is missing in Student Echo’s collection. 

**Student Echo’s Target Audience**

Student Echo is created for students, by students, aiming to empower every user to make the most informed decisions possible. However, it extends itself to a broader audience beyond current students of the University of Manitoba --- encompassing instructors, administrative staff, future students, and more. Ratings and reviews in Student Echo are publicly available to anyone, displayed through an intuitive design that allows for easy and efficient content discovery and navigation. In future iterations, we aim to expand Student Echo to offer its services across multiple universities

**Student Echo’s Value**

For freshmen, Student Echo is a guiding light to navigate through new academic waters, while seniors will find it a strategic tool for optimizing their final year. Instructors can use it as a tool to assess student satisfaction in their courses. Meanwhile, administrative staff (i.e. program planners, department heads, etc.) can review instructor and course feedback to help guide their decisions in forming curriculums. Across all use cases, Student Echo provides tremendous value to numerous individuals in the university community. 
Student Echo is superior to current academic-rating services as it requires students to verify their identity while also protecting their anonymity. Unlike many other services that permit anyone to write reviews, this measure ensures that the content provided is reliable. Student Echo is a free service that ensures full transparency by enabling all individuals to access its ratings and reviews. 

**Student Echo’s Success Criteria**

The success of Student Echo will be determined through data and feedback collected from its users. More specifically, we aim to garner approximately 500 accounts within the first three months of launching Student Echo. As an additional criteria, 25% of these accounts should be active during the next three registration periods after its initial release. On the other hand, user feedback will be obtained in the form of a survey, with the goal of achieving a score of 4/5 or better in terms of overall satisfaction.
